            <h1>The Scientific Revolution</h1>
            <p>Gravity (from Latin gravitas 'weight'), or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy—including planets, stars, galaxies, and even light—are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another.</p>
            <p><b>What lead to the Scientific Revolution?</b><br> The Renaissance was one of the leading causes of the Scientific Revolution. In the 1500s, Europeans began to think about science. Influenced by the ideas of Humanism from the Renaissance Era,
                many became interested in the natural world. They realized that scientists had to use math and experiments to make advances. This revolutionary way of thinking led to the Scientific Revolution.</p>

            <p><b>What scientific advances were made at that time?</b>
                <br>During this Era, many Scientific advances were made, hence the name "Scientific Revolution". They figured out the universe was Heliocentric, or sun-centered, which went against the Church's teachings, who believed it was Geocentric,
                or Earth-centered. An Italian scientist named Galileo Galilei invented the telescope and proved that all objects, no matter the weight, fall at the same speed.</p>
            <p><b>How did new ways of thinking transform Europe?</b><br> These new ways of thinking did lead to a lot of conflict with the Church, but more importantly, the Scientific advances made at that time were unparalleled. These scientific advances
                pushed Europe forward as the powerhouse of their time.
            </p>
            <p><b>What effect has the Scientific Revolution had on us today? </b><br> The Scientific Revolution started a need for answers to the daily questions we ask. It started a need for more advances in science, and today, we are exploring outer space,
                which back then was thought to be impossible.

                            <p>In the first law, an object will not change its motion unless a force acts on it. In the second law, the force on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration. In the third law, when two objects interact, they apply
                                forces to each other of equal magnitude and opposite direction.
